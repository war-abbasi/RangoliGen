# 🎨 RangoliGen 🖌️

RangoliGen is a Python project that generates beautiful rangoli patterns using alphabets. Users can specify the size of the rangoli, and the program will create intricate designs based on the alphabet sequence.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/war-abbasi/RangoliGen.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd RangoliGen
   ```

3. **Run the Python script:**
   ```bash
   python rangoli_gen.py
   ```

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the size of the rangoli.**

## ✨ Example

If the user enters a size of 5, the program will generate the following rangoli:

```
--------e--------
------e-d-e------
----e-d-c-d-e----
--e-d-c-b-c-d-e--
e-d-c-b-a-b-c-d-e
--e-d-c-b-c-d-e--
----e-d-c-d-e----
------e-d-e------
--------e--------
```
